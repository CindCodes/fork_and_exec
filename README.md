# fork_and_exec
This C program was written to demonstrate the use of fork() and exec().
  A file called sum.c declares an integer array that can hold up to 10 integer values. In the first for-loop, the code initializes the integer array with the first 10 natural numbers, excluding 0. In the second for-loop, the code computes the cumulative sum of of those first 10 natural numbers and stores it into the variable called sum. It displays a message with the sum of the first 10 natural numbers using printf statement.
  A file called sum_fork.c forks a child process and stores the return value in a variable called pid. Execv() function ensures the child process executes the previously created binary,sum. Within the child process, the code prints the PID of the process executing instructions. Outside of that, the code ensures the the parent process waits for the completion of the child process and prints the PID of the process executing instructions.
